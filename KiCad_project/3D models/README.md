# Where the 3D models came from

## Arduino Pro Micro

File "sparkfun_pro_micro.x3d" from [kicad-lib-arduino by g200kg on GitHub](https://github.com/g200kg/kicad-lib-arduino/blob/main/Arduino.3dshapes/sparkfun_pro_micro.x3d) , CC0 license.

## Pluggable terminal block

File "2EDGV-5.08-02P-14-00AH.STEP" from [DEGSON 2EDG Series 5.08mm pluggable terminal block pack by Sig Elso on GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/degson-2edg-series-5-08mm-pluggable-terminal-block-pack-1/details?folder_id=9836725). See GrabCAD help article [How can models be used and shared?](https://help.grabcad.com/article/246-how-can-models-be-used-and-shared)

Modified by Peter Froud on July 20th 2022. I opened the STEP file in FreeCAD and then re-exported it to STEP without making any changes, which reduced the file size from 2.2 MB to 1.3 MB.

## XLR connector

File "Neutrik_NC4MBV.stp" from https://www.neutrik.com/en/product/nc4mbv-1. No license information availabe but I asume they want you to use it.
